# About

Hi! 

I am a researcher in AI, currently employed as a PostDoc at the [University of Augsburg](http://www.isse.de).

Coming from a pure software engineering background (I spent much time drawing UML diagrams, devising user stories, and programming), I decided to share some examples/code etc. that I would have found helpful during my transition towards deep learning. That's why I want to help *connecting the dots*. 

In the past, I also had fun writing models for combinatorial optimization problems (think timetabling or scheduling under hard and soft constraints) in [MiniZinc](http://www.minizinc.org) and [MiniBrass](http://minibrass.isse.de).
