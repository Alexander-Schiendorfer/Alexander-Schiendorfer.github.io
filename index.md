Hello and welcome to this blog on various topics in deep learning, machine learning, AI, and computer science, in general.

## Purpose

There are fantastic pages explaining ML concepts out there (CS231n from Stanford, 3Blue1Brown, fast.ai, etc.) - I want to connect some of the dots by providing easy-to-understand examples.

I am convinced that algorithms are taught most efficiently (time invested vs concepts understood) *by example*. Let's work through what is actually computed.
