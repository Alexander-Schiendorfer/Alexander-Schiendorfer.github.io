Hello and welcome to this blog on various topics in deep learning, machine learning, AI, and computer science, in general.

# Purpose

There are fantastic pages explaining ML concepts out there ([CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) from Stanford, [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk), [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/), etc.) - I want to connect some of the dots by providing easy-to-understand examples. Still, you might want to take your time and work through the code thoroughly :-).

I am convinced that algorithms are taught most efficiently (time invested vs concepts understood) *by example*. Let's work through what is actually computed.
